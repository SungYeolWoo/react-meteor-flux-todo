# Meteor â™¥ React

Using Meteor and React together is awesome. You get Meteor's ease of use, data
loading and full-stack reactivity, and React's component-style UI.

This is a meta-package that gives you everything you need to use
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) in your Meteor app. This includes:

1. `react-runtime`, the actual React library that renders view components
2. `jsx`, a build plugin that compiles `.jsx` files into plain JavaScript,
including support for many ES6 features
3. `react-meteor-data`, a mixin that makes it easy to use reactive Meteor data in
your React components

Check out the [React in Meteor guide](http://react-in-meteor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to learn how to use Meteor and React
together to build awesome apps.
